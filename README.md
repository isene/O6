# O6
Open-ended D6 rolls implemented in various programming languages.

See [the Amar RPG wbsite](http:d6gaming.org/index.php/The_Character#Open_Ended_Rolls) for explanation of Open-ended rolls.

So far it seems to me that Forth is the most compact code, while Vimscript and
Fortran are the most verbose, with Julia and Nim perhaps being the most
humanly readable - although I prefer to program in Ruby and FOCAL.
